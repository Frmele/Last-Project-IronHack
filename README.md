DATA BREACHES:RISK ASSESSMENT

The aim of the project is to define based on the chronology of the Data Breaches provided on the website https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches which groups are most likely to be targeted by criminal activity in order to steal data and assist businesses in making informative decisions when it comes to:

-investments in Security

-changes in procedures within a business sector or group in terms of awareness and practices

-improvements in technologies adopted for prevention

For our model we will use clustering.
